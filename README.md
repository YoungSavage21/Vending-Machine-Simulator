# Vending-Machine-Simulator
A simple project which simulates a vending machine. Used basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and implemented basic CRUD. This was my final project for my Web Programming class in semester 1.

# What I Learned:
  - Basic HTML
  - Advanced CSS including the implementation of Flexbox
  - CSS animation and keyframes
  - Basic JavaScript
